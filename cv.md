## About Myself

I have financial education and started my acquaintance with programming with Harvard online course CS50. Sucsefully finished it with final project on Python and continued to learn this language. I made second project on Python (Flask) - parcel traking for online shop. Also I began learning Wordpress for my own needs and as a result I made some web-pages. While I was working on this, I faced the need to deepen my knowledge of CSS, as well as the need to start learning JS. I began to learn JS and how to write HTML code. I continue to grow and develop in learning JS.

I have a high level of self-organization, aimed at solving problems. I am persistent and purposeful, punctual and assiduous.

## Code example

KATA from CODEWARS: In a small town there is the population (p0) at the beginning of a year. The population regularly increases by percents (percent) per year and moreover some new inhabitants (aug) per year come to live in the town. How many years (n) does the town need to see its population greater or equal to (p) inhabitants?

```javascript
function nbYear(p0, percent, aug, p) {
    var n = 1;
    for (var i = 0; p0 <= p; i++) {
        var population = p0 + Math.floor(p0/100*percent) + aug;
        p0 = population;

        if (p0 <= p) {
          n ++;
        } else {
          return n;
        }
    }
} nbYear(p0, percent, aug, p)
