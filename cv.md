## About Myself

I have financial education and for a long period of time I worked in insurance company. On maternity leave I started my acquaintance with programming with Harvard online course CS50. Sucsessfully finished it with final project on Python I continued to learn this language. Also I began learning Wordpress for my own needs. But it wasn't as interesting as writing code so I finished some course on Udemy to try some new things. This way diside to deepen my knowledge in JS.

Being an active, curious person I like challenging tasks and aimed at solving problems. 
I am persistent and purposeful with high level of self-organization.
